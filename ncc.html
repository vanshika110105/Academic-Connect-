                    <h3>History

                    </h3>
                    <p>NCC in India was created with the National Cadet Corps Act of 1948. This happened on 16 July 1948. The origins of the NCC can be traced back to the 'University' Corps, which was created under the Indian Defense Act 1917, with the object of making up for the reduction of the Army. In 1920 the Indian Territorial Act was passed, creating the 'University' The Corps was replaced by the University Training Corps (UTC). The aim was to raise the status of UTC and make it more attractive to the youth. UTC officers and cadets had to dress like military. This was an important step towards the Indianization of the armed forces. The National Cadet Corps was established by the British Government in 1942, which can be regarded as a successor to the University Officer Training Corps. It was named as (UOTSi). During World War II , (UOTC) never came up to the expectations set by the British. This could train more youth in a better way, the committee headed by Pandit Hemwati Kunzru recommended a cadet organization to be established in schools and colleges at a national level. The National Cadet Corps Act was accepted by the Governor General and the National Cadet Corps came into existence on 16 July 1948. [7]
